# Incident Response Playbooks

Some playbook models for incident response with best practices.

Playbook models that I developed with colleagues from my Cybersecurity degree using [LetsDefend](https://letsdefend.io/).

Incident response is a critical aspect of maintaining the security of any organization's digital infrastructure.

Feel free to use, copy, modify, and contribute to these playbooks to improve incident response across the security community.
